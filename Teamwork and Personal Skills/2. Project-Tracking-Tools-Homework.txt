The best project tracking tool for me is Trello.

It is the best because it's really easy and fun to use. 
It provides all the tools for a successful project management.
Registration is simple and most important is that it's free.

In comparison with Trello, Basecamp is paid and it gives you more features and cross-platform compatibility.
It is as well easy to use and compared to Trello, it is far more popular. A lot of big companies are using it.

In comparison with Trello, Asana is free until 15 members(still paid) gives you a lot of features for enchancing teamwork and team workflow.
It is web based and it is simple to use. As Trello, Asana is not so popular.
